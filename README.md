# Experiment-3
Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++
Theory:
Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math:
- + → Addition (a + b)
- - → Subtraction (a - b)
- * → Multiplication (a * b)
- / → Division (a / b)
- % → Modulus (remainder) (a % b)

📝 Assignment Operators
Used to assign or update values:
- = → Assign (a = b)
- += → Add and assign (a += b)
- -= → Subtract and assign (a -= b)
- *= → Multiply and assign (a *= b)
- /= → Divide and assign (a /= b)
- %= → Modulus and assign (a %= b
Relational Operators
Used to compare values (returns true or false):
- == → Equal to (a == b)
- != → Not equal to (a != b)
- > → Greater than (a > b)
- < → Less than (a < b)
- >= → Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
- <= → Less than or equal to (a <= b)

🔀 Logical Operators
Used in conditions and decision-making:
- && → Logical AND (a && b)
- || → Logical OR (a || b)
- ! → Logical NOT (!a)

🧠 Bitwise Operators
Used to manipulate bits directly:
- & → Bitwise AND (a & b)
- | → Bitwise OR (a | b)
- ^ → Bitwise XOR (a ^ b)
- ~ → Bitwise NOT (~a)
- << → Left shift (a << 1)
- >> → Right shift (a >> 1)

🔁 Increment & Decrement Operators
Used to increase or decrease values:
- ++ → Increment (++a or a++)
- -- → Decrement (--a or a--)

🎯 Other Useful Operators
- ?: → Ternary (conditional) operator
- sizeof → Returns size of a data type
- typecast → Converts one type to another
- , → Comma operator (evaluates multiple expressions)
  
  Conclusion:
  Operators are fundamental building blocks in C++ that enable efficient computation, decision-making, and data manipulation. Understanding and applying different types of operators—arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and more—enhances the ability to write clear, concise, and powerful programs. This experiment strengthens the foundation for solving complex problems using operator-based logic.
